# MMIProject

2024SS MMI Final project

## Purpose

This main task of the project is to develop own multimodal game as a group by using Unity

## Implement

- Turn-based Strategy
- haptic + auditory fusion
- animation when attacking

In our game, we can attack with Attack button (mouse haptic input) and voice (microphone input).

For fusion part, we can activate the Max Attack button with high pitch voice. Then we could click the Max Attack Button with mouth.

For fission part, we disabled the normal Attack button when the voice input is detected. We cannot give input in same time with microphone and mouse.
